<p align="center"><b>Eicrud</b> is CRUD/Authorization framework extending <a href="https://github.com/nestjs/nest" target="_blank">NestJS</a>.<br/> It's a tool for building scalable, secure <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> server applications in record time.</p>

## Philosophy

Most of the time, a web app has some CRUD functionality as its base. Eicrud attempts to abstract this into a simple and easy-to-use API, so you don't have to re-write boilerplate code (controllers, validations, db queries...) every time you need a new service. By centering everything around CRUD entities, Eicrud provides a framework for writing complex applications that are easy to read, test and maintain. Eicrud also emphasizes "default security" for its components, where everything is forbidden until allowed.

## How it works

Under the hood, **Eicrud** uses [MikroOrm](https://mikro-orm.io/) entities guarded with [CASL](https://casl.js.org) and [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator).

### Here's a quick example 
You first define your entity with validations and transforms (what the data can be).

```typescript
@Entity()
export class Profile {
  @PrimaryKey()
  @IsString()
  @IsOptional()
  id: string;

  @OneToOne(() => MyUser, (user) => user.profile)
  @IsString()
  owner: MyUser | string;

  @Property()
  @$Transform((val) => val.toLowerCase())
  @MaxLength(30)
  userName: string;
}
```

Then define your security (who can access the data).

```typescript
const security: CrudSecurity = {
  user: {
    async defineCRUDAbility(can, cannot, ctx) {
      const id = ctx.userId;
      // users can crud their own profile
      can('crud', 'profile', { owner: id });
    },
  },
  guest: {
    async defineCRUDAbility(can, cannot, ctx) {
      // guests can read all profiles
      can('read', 'profile');
    },
  },
};
```

And finally, register your service.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ProfileService extends CrudService<Profile> {
  constructor(protected moduleRef: ModuleRef) {
    super(moduleRef, Profile, security);
  }
}
```

**That's it**, `profile` is now a fully operational CRUD service that you can query with the [client](https://docs.eicrud.com/client/setup/).

```typescript
const client = new CrudClient({ serviceName: 'profile' });

const res = await client.findOne({ userName: 'jon doe' });
```

You can extend it using [commands](https://docs.eicrud.com/services/commands/) (for non-CRUD operations).

## Monolithic/Microservices duality

**Eicrud** lets you group your CRUD services into "microservices" with a simple configuration. You can start developing a monolith and easily switch to microservices later on.

```typescript
msOptions.microServices = {
  "entry": {
    services: [],
    openBackDoor: false, openController: true,
    url: "http://localhost:3004",
  },
  "users": {
    services: [User, Profile],
    openBackDoor: true, openController: false,
    url: "http://localhost:3005",
  },
  "orders": {
    services: [Order],
    openBackDoor: true, openController: false,
    url: "http://localhost:3006",
  },
}
```
