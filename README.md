> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Eicrud is still in beta; expect minor breaking changes with new versions until **v1.0.0**. However, you can still use it as it is, and the API will not change much.

## Philosophy

Most of the time, a web app has some CRUD functionality as its base. Eicrud abstracts this into a simple and easy-to-use API, so you don't have to re-write boilerplate code (controllers, validations, db queries...) whenever you need a new service. By centering everything around CRUD entities, Eicrud provides a framework for writing complex applications that are easy to read, test, and maintain. Eicrud also emphasizes "default security" for its components, where everything is forbidden until allowed.

## Features

- ⚙️ Out of the box [CRUD services](https://docs.eicrud.com/services/definition)

- 🔑 [Authentication & user management](https://docs.eicrud.com/user/service/)

- 🔒 [Authorization](https://docs.eicrud.com/security/definition/)

- 🖥️ [Commands](https://docs.eicrud.com/services/commands/)

- ✔️ [Validation/Transform](https://docs.eicrud.com/validation/definition/)

- 🗃️ [Database control](https://docs.eicrud.com/configuration/limits)

- 🚀 Easy to use (RPC) [client](https://docs.eicrud.com/client/setup)

- 🌐 [Monolithic/Microservices](https://docs.eicrud.com/microservices/configuration/)

- And more!

## How it works

Under the hood, **Eicrud** uses [MikroOrm](https://mikro-orm.io/) entities guarded with [CASL](https://casl.js.org) and [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator).

### Here's a quick example 
You first define your entity with validations and transforms (what the data can be).

```typescript
@Entity()
export class Profile {
  @PrimaryKey()
  @IsString()
  @IsOptional()
  id: string;

  @OneToOne(() => MyUser, (user) => user.profile)
  @IsString()
  owner: MyUser | string;

  @Property()
  @$Transform((val) => val.toLowerCase())
  @MaxLength(30)
  userName: string;
}
```

Then define your security (who can access the data).

```typescript
const security: CrudSecurity = {
  user: {
    async defineCRUDAbility(can, cannot, ctx) {
      const id = ctx.userId;
      // users can crud their own profile
      can('crud', 'profile', { owner: id });
    },
  },
  guest: {
    async defineCRUDAbility(can, cannot, ctx) {
      // guests can read all profiles
      can('read', 'profile');
    },
  },
};
```

And finally, register your service.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ProfileService extends CrudService<Profile> {
  constructor(protected moduleRef: ModuleRef) {
    super(moduleRef, Profile, security);
  }
}
```

**That's it**, `profile` is now a fully operational CRUD service that you can query with the [client](https://docs.eicrud.com/client/setup/).

```typescript
const client = new CrudClient({ serviceName: 'profile' });

const res = await client.findOne({ userName: 'jon doe' });
```

You can extend it using [commands](https://docs.eicrud.com/services/commands/) (for non-CRUD operations).

## Monolithic/Microservices duality

**Eicrud** lets you group your CRUD services into "microservices" with a simple configuration. You can start developing a monolith and easily switch to microservices later on.

```typescript
msOptions.microServices = {
  "entry": {
    services: [],
    openMsLink: false, openController: true,
    url: "http://localhost:3004",
  },
  "users": {
    services: [User, Profile],
    openMsLink: true, openController: false,
    url: "http://localhost:3005",
  },
  "orders": {
    services: [Order],
    openMsLink: true, openController: false,
    url: "http://localhost:3006",
  },
}
```

## Powerful typed client (remote procedure call)
**Eicrud** lets you generate a powerful super-client that holds all your DTOs and commands. Allowing auto-completion and type safety directly in your front-end.  
```typescript
// in your profile service
async $say_hello(dto: SayHelloDto, ctx: CrudContext) {
    return `Hello ${dto.myArg}!`
}

// in your frontend
const sp = new SuperClient({url: 'http://localhost:3004'});
sp.profile.say_hello({myArg: 'world'}).then(console.log);
```

## Start building

**Eicrud** is made for code simplicity, you can build your applications in record time using the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eicrud/cli) that will do the heavy work for you.

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.eicrud.com/installation) to get started.
